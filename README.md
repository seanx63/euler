# Euler Solutions
>"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve." -- https://projecteuler.net/

This repository is a collection of personal solutions to Project Euler problems in various programming languages. Each branch will be its own programming language.

Each solution will be named after it's equivalent problem number.

Solutions will also include comments that state the problem, the resulting output, and possibly alternate solutions.
# Java
To run these examples, install [Java](https://adoptium.net/download/).

Then clone this repository and run each example with ``javac ./$NUMBER.java`` and ``java q$NUMBER`` where ``$NUMBER`` is the number of the problem you wish to run.
